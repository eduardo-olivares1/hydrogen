# Project Hydrogen 

## Requirements:

Your final project will involve creating an online store front.  
Your website should have a menu that links to the following pages/sections (containers) -

### The main page
* The Home page should display the store overview.
* This should contain the name of the business with a good description.
* This page should also contain the current date and time.

### People page
* This should list all the members of the team.

### Feedback page
* Here you will elicit feedback from users about your products.  You should alert the users if they enter invalid values.  Each feedback should be specific to a particular product.  The feedback will be written into a database using PHP.
* Users should be able to read the feedback from other users about each product.  You will query the database in order to display this feedback.
* A starter form will be given to you in a file called FeedbackLogin.html..   Modify the form given to you to make it look nicer.
* Add one more field in FeedbackLogin.html to get the user's age.  The user need to be 18 or older to submit the form.  If the user enters an age that is less than 18, alert the user about that.  The age is not stored in the database.
* The form FeedbackLogin.htmlcalls a PHP file called FeedbackSaveAndDisplay.php.  Please change the look and feel of the table that presents the results to the user.
